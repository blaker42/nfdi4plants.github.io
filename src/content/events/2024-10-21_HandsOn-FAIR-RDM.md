## About

The workshop covers the fundamentals of research data management and the principles of FAIR data. In the practical sessions, participants will use DataPLANT's ARCitect to structure a research project and SWATE for metadata annotation. The workshop is intended for members of the 'Ecology and Evolution of Intraspecific Chemodiversity in Plants' (Chemodiv) research unit.
